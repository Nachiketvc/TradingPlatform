## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict, based on historical data, how many days it will take for a patient to be readmitted to the hospital after receiving treatment. The predictions are made for timeframes of 7 Days, 30 Days, 60 Days, and 90 Days.

We address two specific scenarios:

1. Patient Readmission Prediction for Specific Diseases: Predicting readmission intervals for patients with particular conditions.
2. Patient Readmission Prediction for All Diseases: A generalized model for predicting readmission intervals across all conditions.
