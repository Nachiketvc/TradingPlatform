## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict, based on historical data, how many days it will take for a patient to be readmitted to the hospital after receiving treatment. The predictions are made for timeframes of 7 Days, 30 Days, 60 Days, and 90 Days.

We address two specific scenarios:

1. **Patient Readmission Prediction for Specific Diseases:** Predicting readmission intervals for patients with particular conditions.
2. **Patient Readmission Prediction for All Diseases:** A generalized model for predicting readmission intervals across all conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information on diabetic patients and is sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed records of patient demographics, treatments, and hospital visits, making it suitable for both disease-specific and generalized predictions.

## Methodology

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

- Gathered patient treatment data, including demographic, clinical, and procedural information.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and noise.
- Engineered relevant features to capture important patterns in patient data.
  
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Visualized readmission trends and key influencing factors.
- Analyzed readmission rates for specific diseases and generalized trends.

**3. Model Development:**

- Implemented machine learning techniques such as Hybridization, Stacking, and Mixture of Experts to train the model.
- Developed disease-specific and generalized models to handle the two problem statements.
- Explored deep learning architectures for complex patterns in the data, particularly in cases where sequential or unstructured data was involved.
  
**4. Model Evaluation:**

- Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean absolute error (MAE).
- Compared results across the two problem statements to understand the differences in model behavior.

**5.Insights:**

- For specific diseases, the models captured patterns more precisely due to narrower focus and homogeneity in data.
- For all diseases, the model generalized well but required more diverse data and advanced techniques to handle variability.

**6. Future Work:**

- Fine-tuning models with larger and more diverse datasets.
- Exploring transfer learning for disease-specific predictions.
- Incorporating real-time data for continuous model updates.
